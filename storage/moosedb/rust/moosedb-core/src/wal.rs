//! Write-ahead log.
//!
//! The WAL is a sequence of segment files `wal_NNNNNN.tfl.wal`:
//!
//! ```text
//! segment := header entry*
//! header  := "TFWL" version:u16 flags:u16 [cipher params (32 bytes) if ENCRYPTED]
//! entry   := crc32:u32 len:u32 payload[len]     crc32 covers len || payload (as stored)
//! ```
//!
//! The payload is encrypted with AES-256-CTR (keystream offset = file offset)
//! when the table is encrypted. Appends are buffered; durability is reached
//! by `sync`, which the handler calls at statement end.
//!
//! Payload by segment version:
//!
//! ```text
//! v1: row                                  (every entry is committed)
//! v2: kind:u8 body
//!       1 ROW         batch_id:u64 row     row of a batch, not yet committed
//!       2 COMMIT      batch_id:u64         makes every ROW of the batch count
//!       3 ROW_COMMIT  row                  a one-row batch (plain `write`)
//! ```
//!
//! Batches of one table may interleave in the log. Replay applies a batch
//! only when it reaches its COMMIT; rows of batches without one are dropped.
//!
//! A segment number is also the checkpoint unit: the MANIFEST records
//! `wal_seq = N` once every batch committed in segments `<= N` is in sealed
//! chunks, and `replay_seq` (the first segment still needed, which trails
//! `N + 1` while an older batch is open). Segments `< replay_seq` are deleted.
